## Overview
AutoStreamML is an automated machine learning (AutoML) application built using Streamlit. It enables users to easily upload datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with data profiling, and train machine learning models for regression or classification tasks. The application supports automatic preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model saving. Users can conveniently download the trained models for deployment. AutoStreamML simplifies the machine learning pipeline, making it accessible to users without extensive programming knowledge

## About the Project

**AutoStreamML** is a Streamlit-based AutoML tool allowing easy dataset upload, exploratory data analysis, and model training for regression or classification tasks. It automates preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, simplifying the machine learning workflow for users.


## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites:**

1. Python Environment: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Libraries: Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Dataset: Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
4. Streamlit: Familiarity with Streamlit for running the application (`streamlit run app.py`).
5. Machine Learning Knowledge: Basic understanding of machine learning concepts for model interpretation and selection.

These prerequisites will help you effectively utilize the AutoStreamML application.

## Getting Started

"To begin using AutoStreamML:
- Clone the repository to your local machine and install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the application with `streamlit run app.py` and upload your dataset in CSV format through the 'Bring in Data' section.
- Explore your data with the 'Profiling' feature, then select 'Machine Learning' to train models for regression or classification tasks.
- Download the trained model from the 'Download' section for deployment.
- Feel free to contribute by forking the repository and sharing feedback via GitHub issues."
